## Applicability

The rule applies to any [HTML document][] with an associated [Window object][] that has an [event listener list][] with one or more [event listeners][event listener] for [device orientation events][device orientation] or [device motion events][device motion].

## Expectation

For each registered [device orientation event][device orientation] or [device motion event][device motion] in the test target one of the following is true:

- **no changes:** The registered event does not cause [changes to the content][changes in content] of the [web page][]; or
- **same result:** There is at least one set of [instruments][instrument], where each [instrument][] is in the same [web page][] of the registered event or can be found in a [clearly labeled location][] from that [web page][], causing the same [changes in content][] as the event.

## Assumptions

- The motion to operate the device is not used through an [accessibility supported][] interface, which is listed as a valid exception to [SC 2.5.4][sc2.5.4].
- The motion is not [essential][] for the functionality it triggers, which is listed as a valid exception to [SC 2.5.4][sc2.5.4].
- If the [web page][] is rendering time-based media, rendered pixels and audio will be changing as part of the playback. The comparison in this instance should compare the pixels and audio that are rendered if the event is not fired, with the ones that are rendered if the event is fired.
- This rule assumes that the event causing the changes is the only origin of changes to the [web page][] and therefore the page does not change if there is no such event. If this is not the case, changes may be attributed to the wrong event and the rule may fail while [SC 2.5.4][sc2.5.4] is still satisfied.
- This rule assumes that the changes happen instantly after the event firing and therefore the comparison between the page before and after the event firing can be made at any time after the firing of the event. If there is a significant delay between firing the event and the changes happening, they may not be detected as [changes in content][] and the rule may pass but [SC 2.5.4][sc2.5.4] is not satisfied.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.4: Motion Actuation][sc2.5.4]
- [G213: Provide conventional controls and an application setting for motion activated input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G213.html)
- [DeviceOrientation Event Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/orientation-event/)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This [HTML document][] has device orientation events that cause **no changes** to the content of the web page.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Passed Example 1</title>
		<script>
			function activateEvent() {
				let counter = 0
				window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', () => {
					counter++
				})
			}
		</script>
	</head>

	<body onload="activateEvent();">
		<p>ACT-R</p>
		<p>Note: This example may not work across all browsers.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This [HTML document][] that can be operated through the device's orientation to increase and decrease the value of a slider has the **same result** available through `button` elements.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Passed Example 2</title>
		<script src="/test-assets/7677a9/slider.js"></script>
		<script>
			function activateSlider() {
				document.getElementById('decreaseSlider').addEventListener('click', decreaseSlider)
				document.getElementById('increaseSlider').addEventListener('click', increaseSlider)
				window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', handleOrientation)
			}
		</script>
	</head>

	<body onload="activateSlider();">
		<pre class="output"></pre>

		<h1>Slider Motion Sensor Example</h1>

		<p>
			Open this slider on a device with a motion sensor, such as a smart phone or tablet. Tilt the device to the right
			and left to adjust the slider value. The decrease and increase buttons also adjust the value.
		</p>
		<p>Note: This example may not work across all browsers.</p>

		<div>
			<button id="decreaseSlider" type="button">Decrease Value</button>
			<input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" id="motionSlider" disabled />
			<button id="increaseSlider" type="button">Increase Value</button>
			<p aria-live="polite">Slider Value: <span id="output">50</span></p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This [HTML document][] that can be operated by rotating the device to increase and decrease the value of a slider has the **same result** available through `button` elements.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Passed Example 3</title>
		<script src="/test-assets/7677a9/slider.js"></script>
		<script>
			function activateSlider() {
				document.getElementById('decreaseSlider').addEventListener('click', decreaseSlider)
				document.getElementById('increaseSlider').addEventListener('click', increaseSlider)
				window.addEventListener('devicemotion', handleMotion)
			}
		</script>
	</head>

	<body onload="activateSlider();">
		<pre class="output"></pre>

		<h1>Slider Motion Sensor Example</h1>

		<p>
			Open this slider on a device with a motion sensor, such as a smart phone or tablet. Rotate the device to adjust
			the slider value. The decrease and increase buttons also adjust the value.
		</p>
		<p>Note: This example may not work across all browsers.</p>

		<div>
			<button id="decreaseSlider" type="button">Decrease Value</button>
			<input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" id="motionSlider" disabled />

			<p aria-live="polite">Slider Value: <span id="output">50</span></p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 4

This [HTML document][] can be operated by rotating the device to increase and decrease the value of a slider and the location of an [instrument][] to support the **same results** is clearly available.

			function openModal() {
				document.getElementById('overlay').style.display = 'block'
			}
			function closeModal() {
				document.getElementById('overlay').style.display = 'none'
			}
		</script>

	<body onload="activateSlider();">
		<pre class="output"></pre>

		<h1>Slider Motion Sensor Example</h1>

		<p>
			Open this slider on a device with a motion sensor, such as a smart phone or tablet. Rotate the device to adjust
			the slider value. Activate the control panel to access decrease and increase buttons that also adjust the value.
		</p>
		<input type="button" onclick="openModal()" value="Control panel" />
		<p>Note: This example may not work across all browsers.</p>

		<input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" id="motionSlider" disabled />
		<p aria-live="polite">Slider Value: <span id="output">50</span></p>

		<div
			style="
        display: none;
        position: fixed;
        top: 17em;
        left: 1em;
        background-color: #505050;
        color: white;
        padding: 0.5em;
      "
			id="overlay"
		>
			<button id="decreaseSlider" type="button">Decrease Value</button>
