## Applicability

The rule applies to any [focusable][] element.

## Expectation

For each target element, there exists a set of [focus indicators][focus indicator] which are not all also [focus indicators][focus indicator] for another [focusable][] element.

## Assumptions

The definition of [focus indicator][] is based on the tree order but users are likely to perceive relationship based on position on the rendered page. If these are greatly different, the rule will produce incorrect results.

## Accessibility Support

WCAG does not have any requirement of how big or small focus indicator should be and it is possible to pass this rule and [Success Criterion 2.4.7: Focus Visible][sc247] with barely perceptible changes that would thus still be an accessibility issue. WCAG 2.2 is working on an extended Success Criterion 2.4.11 specifying how big the focus indicator should be. See the [Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.11: Focus Visible (Enhanced)][usc2411] proposal.
