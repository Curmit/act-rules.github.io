An _explicit section of content_ is a subtree of the [flat tree][], rooted at an element with a [semantic role][] which is one of the sectioning roles (defined just after), except if it is the only child of an element whose [semantic role][] is one of the sectioning roles.

The _sectioning roles_ considered here are: the [`document`][document] role; any role that inherits from [`document`][document]; any role that inherits from [`landmark`][landmark].

If a descendant of the root of an explicit section of content is a [browsing context container][], then the full content of the associated [nested browsing context][] is also included in this explicit section of content.

Explicit sections of content may have zero or one heading [associated][] with them.

**Note:** The `article` role (inheriting from `document`) is included in this definition because the `article` element is [sectioning content][] used by the [algorithm for creating an outline][outline algorithm].

**Note:** The roles considered here are close but different from the [implicit roles][] of [sectioning content][] and [sectioning root][] elements. Notably, the `body` element itself does not define an explicit section of content.

**Note:** When one of these elements is the single child of a similar element, they have the exact same content. Therefore, having them form a single explicit section of content does not lose structural information.

**Note:** A subtree rooted at a node is this node and all its descendants.

**Note:** Explicit sections of content are only useful for users of technologies that somehow expose these elements, for example by listing landmarks or providing a way to navigate directly to them.
